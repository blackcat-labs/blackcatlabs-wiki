# Policies
Nobody likes rules, but we do have a few you should be aware of, to keep this ship afloat.

Our [Terms of Service](terms.md) are the core rules that govern our members' relationship with us and are the final word on most "can and can't" issues.

Our [Privacy Policy](privacy.md) covers what information we collect about you and how we (don't) use it.

We provide information about our [Abuse handling policies](abuse.md) as well as our [DMCA notification guidelines](dmca.md).

You can view a list of all other service providers we use to provide Galaxy.sh services in our [Subprocessors list](subprocessors.md).

!!! warning
    These are the Black Cat Labs **global** policies. 
    
    Specific Black Cat Labs products may have their own, modified, policies.

    **Always** check the policies for the specific product that you are using.

??? danger "Controlled Document"
    Inline with our internal policy as well as legal and contractual obligations, changes to [Controlled Documents](../meta/editing/controlled-documents.md) must be approved and merged by an administrator. Please discuss with @thh or another admin before making any changes.

!!! example "In Development"
    As our products develop and mature, these policies are subject to change. You can view the date of last change at the bottom of each page on this site. Specific changes to policies can be found on our [:material-github: GitHub Repo](https://github.com/blackcat-labs/blackcatlabs-wiki/tree/main/docs/policies).

!!! info "Hat tip:"
    The majority of these policies have been adapted from policies published by [NFSN](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/policies), [omg.lol](https://github.com/neatnik/omg.lol/tree/main/info/About), and [Basecamp](https://github.com/basecamp/policies/tree/master).
