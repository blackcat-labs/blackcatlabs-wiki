# Terms of Service
!!! warning
    These are the Black Cat Labs **global** Terms of Service. 
    
    Specific Black Cat Labs products may have their own, modified, Terms of Service.

    **Always** check the Terms of Service for the specific product that you are using.

## Intro
Our Terms of Service can be (very) briefly summarized as:

"We promise to always try to do the right thing. If you do too, it'll all be cool."

Please report any violations of our Terms of Service at [:octicons-shield-16: Reporting Abuse](../contact/abuse.md). Due to our [Privacy Policy](privacy.md), we may not be able to give you much information about any action we take in response to your report, but we will give it full consideration.

## Awareness
Black Cat Labs LLC ("Black Cat Labs", we/us) provides certain content and infrastructure hosting services ("Service", "Services") to you, subject to these Terms of Service ("Terms", "TOS"). The Terms apply to your use of our services whether or not you like or agree with them, and whether or not you take the time to fully digest them.

We may change these Terms or make new Terms at any time. Although we will attempt to notify you through reasonable means when the Terms change, we are under no obligation to do so.

You can always find the latest Terms at this web address, and can view revisions on our [:material-github: GitHub Repo](https://github.com/blackcat-labs/blackcatlabs-wiki/tree/main/docs/policies/terms.md).

## Registration
Memberships for our products are held by individuals. This leads to three important notes:  

-   **You may only have one membership.**
-   **You may not create a membership for anyone other than yourself.**
-   **No one but you may access your membership.**

Some products may include features (such as "projects") which allow you to share aspects of the product with additional memberships. Please see the documentation for each product for additional information.

You must provide accurate, complete, and current information about yourself as needed for registration and payment ("Registration Information"). In the event of a change, you must promptly update the Registration Information to ensure that it remains accurate, complete, and current.

In certain cases, to protect our Services, networks, and infrastructure from threat actors[^2], we may conduct additional identity verification ("Know Your Customer", "KYC") when you attempt to register or make use of our Services.

Black Cat Labs will handle Registration Information and KYC Information in accordance with a published privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") available here: [Privacy Policy](privacy.md).

## Refunds
We want you to be happy with our service. However, we understand that it is not for everyone. We offer a very flexible refund policy in keeping with our belief that you should be able to try things out without taking a big risk.

If you are using a product that bills out of a pre-paid balance, we will refund the unused balance of your account(s) and close your membership at any time upon request.

If you are using a product that bills monthly or yearly at a flat rate, we will issue refunds as follows: For monthly payments, we will refund, at minimum, your last month's payment. For yearly payments, we will refund, at minimum, a prorated portion of your payment, depending on how far through your payment you are. (For example, if you are 9 months in to a year's payment, we would refund the remaining 1/4 of your payment.)

We typically issue refunds through the same method that you used to pay. If this is not possible (e.g., due to time limits on refunds imposed by our payment processors), we will try to offer you a variety of refund options, some of which may carry a fee based on the cost.

Refunds can be requested by [contacting support](../contact/README.md/#material-chat-question-getting-help).

## Payment Practices
### For Products With Pre-Paid Balances
We charge your payment method only at your request and only with your authorization. If you submit a payment method as payment, you warrant to us that you have provided true and accurate information and that you are fully authorized to use that payment method.

We do not keep payment information above and beyond the minimum amount necessary (which may include your name, billing address, the last four digits of the card number, and/or charge/payment identifiers) to identify transactions. This means we can never charge you for other transactions unless you explicitly log in and provide your card information.

### For Products Which Are Billed Monthly/Yearly
By providing payment information, you authorize us to charge your payment method on a recurring basis. Depending on the product, this charge may be a flat fee (for example, "$5.00 per month"), or the charge may vary depending on your usage of the product ("Usage-Based Pricing").

You can view your pricing plan, current method of payment, and anticipated upcoming charges in the billing portal for your product(s).

### For All Products
As described in the [Refunds section](#refunds), we have a very flexible refund policy. Therefore, there should be no reason to ever file a chargeback or dispute. We investigate all such requests as potential fraud, and are required to freeze all affected accounts while the investigation is in progress. Depending on the results of our investigation, we reserve the right to terminate accounts associated with fraudulant chargebacks.

Should you commit payment fraud of any kind in conjunction with our service, we will wreak dreadful vengeance upon you to the fullest extent of the law.

    We hope to revisit this topic in the future.
