## About
### Public by Default
Everything at Black Cat Labs is public by default. This allows a wider audience to take a peek inside, benefit from shared knowledge, and maybe even get involved. That's why we have this nice open wiki, and have the majority of our resources (this wiki included) [:material-github: on GitHub](https://github.com/blackcat-labs/blackcatlabs-wiki).

For information that can't be public--that which would put the company or our users/members at risk--we do also have an internal wiki, [:octicons-lock-24: wiki-internal.blackcatlabs.dev](https://wiki-internal.blackcatlabs.dev).

### Constantly Evolving
!!! example "Everything is in Draft"
    Remember that this handbook, like most projects from Black Cat Labs, is always in draft and subject to change. When everything is in draft, contributions from team members as well as the wider community are welcomed.

    You can track changes made to this handbook [:material-github: on GitHub](https://github.com/blackcat-labs/blackcatlabs-wiki).

### Open to Interpretation
This wiki is subject to interpretation. We do our best to be as clear as possible to minimize confusion and/or misinterpretation. We also recognize that folks have a wide variety of languages, experience, and knowledge, and that may bring different interpretations. If you have any questions or need further clarification please check with the content owner of the page. When in doubt please reach out and ask.

### Contributions Welcome
!!! note "You can contribute!"
    We welcome anyone to submit contributions to this site. This site, like most projects from Black Cat Labs, is [:material-github: available on GitHub](https://github.com/blackcat-labs/blackcatlabs-wiki).

    If you have changes you'd like to see, please submit a pull request!

    A contribution and editing guide is in the works, we hope to release it soon.
