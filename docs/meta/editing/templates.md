# MkDocs Templates
This page contains quick code snippets that can be used to quickly insert commonly-used objects into MkDocs pages.

## Icons
Please see the [:material-arrow-right:Icons](../Tech-Stack/icons.md) page.

## Admonitions
Admonitions (or call-outs) are the text blocks around this site. Examples of each admonition, as well as use cases for many of them, are provided below. Please see [:octicons-link-external-16: here](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/) for additional information about admonitions.

Note that the default code provided does **not** have the blocks collapsed. Change the `!!!` to `???` make the box collapsible. `???+` makes the box collapsible, but renders as "open" by default.
