# Cloudflare Access
Our internal wiki is hosted with Cloudflare Pages. In order to restrict access to Black Cat Labs team members only, we currently use Cloudflare Access to gate access to this website.

This method may change in the future.

## Sign In Methods
There are two different options you can use to sign in to Cloudflare Access, and thus, the internal wiki.

**Azure AD:** If you have an `@blackcatlabs.dev` or `@blkcat.space` email address, please log in using Azure AD and enter that email address.  
**GitHub:** If you do not have a dedicated email address, you can log in using GitHub. Please note that you must be a member of the `blackcat-labs` GitHub organziation in order to sign in with GitHub.
